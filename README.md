It's code to create a batch file to show a cli windnow and resize it that shows data in YYYY/MM/DD format and time with seconds as HH:MM:SS to have them easily available when prototyping with a 3D printer, in order to write data and time on the part to identify it, if it is the best release candidate

when launched it shows:

Date: YYYY/MM/DD
Time: HH:MM:SS

it is updating every second to show seconds count and it is automatically resized to tiny proportions to only show the data and time. As personal preference it is launched by another batch file that start this one plus autodesk fusion 360 simultaneously.
